# Data Analysis and Applied Economics Slides
Slides for AIDE Lab undergraduate internship training in Data Analysis and Applied Economics at the University of Arizona, adapted from @NickCH-K class on Causal Inference at Seattle University.

This class follows my textbook [The Effect: An Introduction to Research Design and Causality](http://nickchk.com/causalitybook.html), for which the first half is currently available online, although additional chapters will be available soon.

It also makes use of my series of [Videos on Causality](http://nickchk.com/videos.html#causality), with the note that these videos cover causal concepts but not estimation - they don't even use regression. The class does use regression.
